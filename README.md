As a first web development project, creating a landing page has been a fascinating learning curve. 
I've acquired knowledge about the principles of web development, how to think analytically about design decisions,
and gained the confidence to continue my exploration of the online development industry. This experience opened
the road for my growth as a web developer and gave meÂ a solid foundation to expand on.

Level 1 - Task 2 - Personal Portfolio 
I've learned about responsive web design during this project, ensuring that my portfolio appears excellent on a variety of devices. 
Debugging and cross-browser compatibility issues that I ran into taught me how to troubleshoot and guarantee a positive user experience. 
In general, this project has helped me gain a solid foundation in HTML and CSS as well as an understanding of web design concepts and user-friendly content structure. I'm eager to develop as a web developer as I take on additional tasks and investigate cutting-edge technology.

Level 1 - Task 3 - Calculator 
Software: Visual Studio Code 
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a simple calculator has been a learning experience, to put it briefly. I have gained knowledge of the fundamentals of web programming through this project, including how to organize a page, create an interactive interface, and apply functional logic. I now have a strong basis to build on, and as I advance in the realm of programming and web development, I'm excited to explore increasingly challenging projects.
