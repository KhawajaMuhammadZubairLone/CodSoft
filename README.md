As a first web development project, creating a landing page has been a fascinating learning curve. 
I've acquired knowledge about the principles of web development, how to think analytically about design decisions,
and gained the confidence to continue my exploration of the online development industry. This experience opened
the road for my growth as a web developer and gave meÂ a solid foundation to expand on.

Level 1 - Task 2 - Personal Portfolio 
I've learned about responsive web design during this project, ensuring that my portfolio appears excellent on a variety of devices. 
Debugging and cross-browser compatibility issues that I ran into taught me how to troubleshoot and guarantee a positive user experience. 
In general, this project has helped me gain a solid foundation in HTML and CSS as well as an understanding of web design concepts and user-friendly content structure. 
'm eager to develop as a web developer as I take on additional tasks and investigate cutting-edge technology.
